CHAPTER 1: TYPES

<--- BUILT-IN TYPES --->
- JS defines seven built-in types:
  1. null
  2. undefined
  3. boolean
  4. number
  5. string
  6. object
  7. symbol
- All of the above typees except OBJECT are called "primitives".
- The TYPEOF operator is used to inspect the type of any given value.
  - See ../examples/typeof.js
