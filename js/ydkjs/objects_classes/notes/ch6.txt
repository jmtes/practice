CHAPTER 6: BEHAVIOR DELEGATION

<--- RECAP --->
- The [[Prototype]] mechanism is an internal link that exists on one object and which references another object.
- This linkage is exercised when a property/method reference is made against the first object and no such property/method exists.
  - In this case, the [[Prototype]] linkage tells the engine to look for the property/method in the linked-to object.
- The [[Prototype]] chain is followed until either the property/method is found or the chain ends (usually at Object.prototype).

<--- TOWARDS DELEGATION-ORIENTED DESIGN --->
- Some principles of class-oriented design, namely encapsulation, are still valid and compatible with delegation.
  - It's still not commonly seen, though.

<--- CLASS THEORY --->
- Let's say we have several similar tasks (XYZ, ABC, etc.) that we need to model in our software.
- With the class design pattern, you'd:
  1. Define a general parent (base) class, say `Task`.
    - This defines shared behavior for all "alike" tasks.
  2. Define child classes like `ABC` and `XYZ`.
  - Both inherit from Task and add specialized behavior to handle their respective tasks.
  3. Instantiate one or more copies of the XYZ child class and use those instances to perform task "XYZ".
- The class design pattern will encourage you to employ method overriding and polymorphism to get the most out of inheritance.
  - You may even use SUPER to call to the base version of some method while adding more behavior to it.
- After construction, you will generally only interact with these instances (not the classes!) because each has a copy of all the behavior needed to do the intended task.

<--- DELEGATION THEORY --->
- Let's think of the same problem, but using behavior delegation instead of classes:
  1. Define an object called Task.
    - This object will have concrete behavior on it that includes utility methods that various tasks can use (delegate to).
  2. For each task (ABC, XYZ), define an object to hold that task-specific data/behavior.
  3. Link the task specific-object(s) to the Task utility object, allowing them to delegate to it when they need to.
- Basically, think about performing task XYZ as needing behaviors from two sibling objects (XYZ and Task).
  - You don't need to compose them together via class copies though. 
  - Rather, you keep them in their separate objects and allow the XYZ object to DELEGATE TO Task as needed.
- See ../examples/delegation_theory.js

<--- CLASS THINKING VS DELEGATION THINKING --->
- Classes visualize objects as vertically oriented.
  - Parent class behavior flows down to child classes.
- Delegation visualizes objects as being side-by-side peers.
  - Links between objects can go in any direction as necessary.

<--- OBJECTS-LINKED-TO-OTHER-OBJECTS (OLOO) STYLE CODE GUIDELINES --->
- In general, with [[Prototype]] delegation involved, you want state to be on the delegators (XYZ, ABC) and not on the delegate (Task).
- Avoid shadowing by not naming things the same at different levels of the [[Prototype]] chain.
  - Having such name collisions creates brittle code to disambiguate references.
  - Use more descriptive method names so they're not as prone to overriding.
    - These names should be specific to the type of behavior each object is doing.
    - This can create code that's easier to understand and maintain because the method names are obvious and thus self-documenting!

<--- CIRCULAR DELEGATION (NOT ALLOWED) --->
- You cannot create a cycle where two or more objects delegate to each other.
- If you link object A to object B and then try to link B to A, you will get an error!
  - If you try to access a property/method that doesn't exist in either object, you'd get stuck indefinitely following the [[Prototype]] chain!

<--- BROWSER DEVELOPER TOOLS --->
- See ../example/chrome_dev_tools.js

<--- COMPARING MENTAL MODELS --->
- See ../examples/comparing_mental_models.js
- OLOO-style code has vastly fewer things to worry about.
  - This is because OLOO-style code embraces the fact that the only thing we really care about are the links between objects!
- All the other "class" cruft was just a confusing and complex way of getting the same end result.
  - Remove that stuff and things get much simpler without losing any capability!

<--- THE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF JS'S MECHANISMS --->
- The ability of a JS function to access call(...), apply(...), and bind(...) is because functions themselves are objects linked to the Function.prototype object.
  - It defines all those default methods that any function object can delegate to!

<--- CLASSES VS OBJECTS --->
- See ../examples/classes_vs_objects.js
