WHAT IS THE DOM?

- Stands for Document Object Model
- Structured representation of an HTML document
- Tree of nodes/elements created by the browser
- The word "node" is used to refer to any HTML element wrapped in a tag. A div is a node!
- JS can be used to read/write/manipulate the DOM
- Object Oriented Representation

The browser gives us a window object and inside that we have the document object. This represents the loaded document or web page. We have a root element underneath the document which is the <html> tag. The children of the <html> tag are the <head> and the <body> tags.

JS is used to manipulate these nodes.

Technically, libraries such as jQuery make this easier but it' definitely worth it to learn how to do everything with vanilla JS! Especially with querySelector! You'll have a greater appreciation for these libraries afterward!
Additionally, not using jQuery makes things faster because you don't have the extra overhead. Using jQuery to select elements from the DOM is like using a sledgehammer to kill a mosquito.
