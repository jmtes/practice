ASYNC INTRO
There are three ways to perform asynchronous operations in JS:
1. Callbacks
2. Promises (new to ES6)
3. Async/Await - Make them look like synchronous operations


AJAX
- AJAX stands for Asynchrnous Javascript and XML
- Not a language, framework, or library, but a set of web technologies to asynchronously send/receive data from a client and server
- Makes async requests behind the scenes without having to explicitly reload the webpage
- XML isn't really used anymore and has been largely replaced with JSON
- AJAX also works with plain text
- Makes web pages very interactive

THE XmlHttpRequest OBJECT
- The core technology in AJAX
- Provided by the browser's JS environment
- Methods transfer data between client and server
- Can be used with protocols other than HTTP
- Can work with data other than XML such as JSON and plain text

LIBRARIES AND OTHER METHODS FOR HTTP REQUESTS
- Fetch API (part of the browser and core JS) (RECOMMENDED)
- Axios (external library)
- Superagent (external library)
- jQuery (DOM manipulation library)
- Node HTTP
